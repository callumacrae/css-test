This project is a combination of two things: it is an experiment to see
how far CSS can be pushed without the need for any JavaScript, and it
will also serve as a small website / online business card for its
author, Callum Macrae.

# Browser Support

It currently supports the following browsers:

<table><tr><td>Chrome &gt; 12</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Firefox &gt; 5</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Safari &gt; 5</td><td>sometimes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Opera</td><td>not really - CSS animations not supported</td></tr>
<tr><td>IE</td><td>pfft</td></tr></table>

Fallbacks will not be written for browsers that do not support the CSS3
used. This project is using nothing but standards, and so as browsers
improve this website may start working in them.
